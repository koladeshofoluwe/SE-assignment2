‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage Examples
This project centers around a simple text file that was modified across different branches to simulate a software development cycle.

Core Files
README.md: This document.

HelloWrld.txt: The core file used to demonstrate version control and conflict resolution.

Running the "Program"
Since the primary file is a text file, you can view its contents using the cat command in your terminal:

Bash

# View the content of the file used in the conflict resolution
cat HelloWrld.txt
(The content you see should be the final, merged, and conflict-resolved version of the greeting.)
